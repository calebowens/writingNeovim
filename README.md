If I ever publicly share this script. DO NOT TRUST IT! This script uses administrator permissions to install programs and could accidentally break everything. This is for my use only.

On the other hand, if you do want to try it out, use run setup.ps1.

edit: I have decided to make this public so I can easily clone it from places without setting up ssh keys. Please don't use it.
